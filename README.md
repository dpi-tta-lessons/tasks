# Task management workflow

_Make the invisible visible_

## Goals

- Make it easy to see what's going on in the team.
- Make sure we're working on the right things, and not just what's urgent/easy. [Streetlight effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect)
- Make sure things aren't slipping through the cracks.
- Make sure we're not going in circles by having a record of what we've done and the rationale for doing it. [Chesterton's Fence](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/chestertons-fence)

## GitHub tips

- Use the ["Tasks assigned to me" page](https://github.com/issues/assigned) to see all of the issues that are on your plate at a glance.
- Learn [Markdown](https://gist.github.com/raghubetina/a1b6e89e24a8c3acae6f0b63a1fd3323) to format your writing in GitHub more easily.
- [Manage your notification settings](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications) to ensure that you're seeing what you need to, but not so much that you get overwhelmed and stop paying attention.
